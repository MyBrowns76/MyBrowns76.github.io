            <p>
            Im a loving family man that has many passions in life like cooking, spending
             quality time with my family,learning new things and being an all around better person.
             I was born in Cleveland and moved to the Columbus Ohio area to
             pursue my passion at the time culinary arts. 
             After COVID-19 my career took major hit which lead on a different path to
            pursue a different promising field as a full stack developer.

            <p class="project__description"></p>
                During my time at We Can Code It I learned many things like strings, variables, arrays, loops and inheritance, we have created
                a virtual shelter game. The player has a choice to adopt a pet or bring a pet to the shelter and do few
                activities with it. We have organic and robotic pets in our shelter. The player can name, feed,
                water and play with the pets.

                <h3>FizzBuzzQix</h3>
                In this project we are given one test, then we had to write the rest on our own. We took the old Fizz Buzz kata out for a ride, but we then added a new feature to develop: Qix. The functionality was that I had to test out for FizzBuzzQix by:
                Given an integer, return a String representation of that integer.
                Given an integer that is a multiple of three, return a String that contains the word "Fizz".
                Given an integer that is a multiple of five, return a String that contains the word "Buzz".
                Given an integer that is a multiple of seven, return a String that contains the word "Qix".
                If multiple words were used, add them in order of Fizz, Buzz, then Qix.

                <h3>Fortune Teller</h3>
            </p>
                We developed a console application that will tell the userâ€™s fortune based on data received from the user.
                The skills we used were variables, basic types operators,expressions conditionals and strings.<p>
